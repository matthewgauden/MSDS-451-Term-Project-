# MSDS-451-Term-Project-

## Intro
This is the term project repository for MSDS 451 Financial Engineering. The term project asks us to create a hypothetical fund -- in this case, an ETF -- and provide a general prospectus into the fund's investment philosophy as well as providing academic research, and eventually adding code that will perform portfolio optimization/simulation for an imaginary investor. 

## Checkpoint A
Checkpoint A is the first step in building the fund. In the checkpoint pdf, you will find the general philosophy when it comes to my created ETF (name will be decided in the future). The report also contains relevant academic research that I found that is relevant to my firm and our goals. This repository will be updated as the course goes along, with Checkpoints B and C, as well as the final product being added when they are complete. 

## AI Dislaimer
ChatGPT was used to simply scour the web and find potential academic sources for my project. All sources produced by ChatGPT were reviewed and only the ones I deemed to be relevant and useful were read and used.
